# System Design & Architecture Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository is a curated collection of system design case studies that I've developed to demonstrate my skills in building scalable, fault-tolerant, and highly available distributed systems.

As a software engineer with 4 years of experience in the Java ecosystem, my focus is on the practical application of these architectural principles to solve real-world problems.

Each design includes:
- High-level architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Data models
- A detailed discussion of the key trade-offs involved

Feel free to explore the folders to see each individual case study.
